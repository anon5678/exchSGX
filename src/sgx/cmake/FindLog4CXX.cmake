# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#  find_package(Log4CXX)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  LOG4CXX_ROOT_DIR  Set this variable to the root installation of
#                  	 Log4cxx Library if the module has problems finding
#                    the proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  LOG4CXX_FOUND              System has Log4cxx libs/headers
#  LOG4CXX_LIBRARIES          The Log4cxx libraries
#  LOG4CXX_INCLUDE_DIRS       The location of Log4cxx headers
